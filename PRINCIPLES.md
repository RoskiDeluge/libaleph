## Aleph-Stack: *Design Dissolving in Agency*  

1. **Affordances, not interfaces.** What matters is what can be doneâ€”not how it looks when done.  
2. **Quiet infrastructure.** Like air or gravity, the stack should be felt only in its absence.  
3. **No spectacle.** Avoid ornamental UI or conceptual overhead; agents need contracts, not cosmetics.  
4. **Behavior as design.** A system is judged by how seamlessly agents achieve goals, not how neatly it renders.  
5. **Defaults dissolve friction.** The safest, most direct path should require no extra negotiation.  
6. **Composability over monoliths.** Small affordances should fit together like behaviors, not force a framework.  
7. **Idempotency is empathy.** Respectful design means agents never fear duplication or loss.  
8. **Transparency through schema.** Clarity comes from explicit contracts, not documentation alone.  
9. **Optional human presence.** People may enter the loop, but should never be prerequisites for function.  
10. **Disappearance as success.** The more invisible the stack becomes, the closer it aligns with its purpose.
