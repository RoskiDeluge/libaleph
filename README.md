# libaleph
## A library of affordances for the agentic web.  

> Aleph Stack is the philosophy: a re-presentation of the Web as an affordance-first, agent-native substrate. It is a call to move beyond the page as the atomic unit, toward protocols, contracts, and intents as the true primitives of digital interaction.

> libaleph is the first implementation: a reference library of manifests, schemas, capability tokens, and event protocols that make Aleph Stack concrete. Where Aleph Stack is the idea, libaleph is the codeâ€”just as the World Wide Web was the vision, and libwww its first embodiment.
