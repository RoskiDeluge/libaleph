# libaleph
## A library of affordances for the agentic web.  

> Aleph Stack begins from presentations, not representations: affordances that are immediately active rather than symbolic stand-ins. Text becomes the runtime itself, where intents and schemas are live contracts agents can act on directly. UI and hypermedia remain, but only as derivative projections—print-on-demand views for humans, not the substrate of the Web.

> libaleph is the first implementation: a reference library of manifests, schemas, capability tokens, and event protocols that make Aleph Stack concrete. Where Aleph Stack is the idea, libaleph is the code—just as the World Wide Web was the vision, and libwww its first embodiment.

## Usage Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoskiDeluge/libaleph
cd libaleph
npm install
npm run dev:server
curl http://localhost:3000/.well-known/agent
```

## Philosophy of Action: Presentation Before Representation

Traditional web systems are built on representations: pages, interfaces, and metaphors that stand in for deeper actions. Buttons, forms, and layouts are symbolic—they point toward a possibility, but they are not the possibility itself.

Aleph Stack begins instead from presentations: affordances that are immediately active. An intent object, a schema, or a manifest is not a description waiting to be interpreted; it is a live contract, callable by an agent or projected into a view for a human.

This shift implies a different philosophy of action:

Do first, narrate later. Actions are executable primitives; interfaces are optional interpretations.

Affordances are canonical. They present themselves directly in text-as-runtime.

Representations are derivatives. UI and hypermedia become “print-on-demand” layers for humans, not the substrate itself.

Just as living bodies act before they symbolize or narrate, Aleph recovers presentation as the foundation of interaction. Representation remains valuable, but only as a secondary projection of a presentative core.
