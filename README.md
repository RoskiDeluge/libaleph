# libaleph
## A library of affordances for the agentic web.  

> Aleph Stack is the philosophy: a re-presentation of the Web as an affordance-first, agent-native substrate. It is a call to move beyond the page as the atomic unit, toward protocols, contracts, and intents as the true primitives of digital interaction.

> libaleph is the first implementation: a reference library of manifests, schemas, capability tokens, and event protocols that make Aleph Stack concrete. Where Aleph Stack is the idea, libaleph is the code—just as the World Wide Web was the vision, and libwww its first embodiment.

## Aleph-Stack Manifesto: *Design Dissolving in Agency*  

1. **Affordances, not interfaces.** What matters is what can be done—not how it looks when done.  
2. **Quiet infrastructure.** Like air or gravity, the stack should be felt only in its absence.  
3. **No spectacle.** Avoid ornamental UI or conceptual overhead; agents need contracts, not cosmetics.  
4. **Behavior as design.** A system is judged by how seamlessly agents achieve goals, not how neatly it renders.  
5. **Defaults dissolve friction.** The safest, most direct path should require no extra negotiation.  
6. **Composability over monoliths.** Small affordances should fit together like behaviors, not force a framework.  
7. **Idempotency is empathy.** Respectful design means agents never fear duplication or loss.  
8. **Transparency through schema.** Clarity comes from explicit contracts, not documentation alone.  
9. **Optional human presence.** People may enter the loop, but should never be prerequisites for function.  
10. **Disappearance as success.** The more invisible the stack becomes, the closer it aligns with its purpose.
